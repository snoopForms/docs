## Feature Overview

- **Code & No-Code:** Work with the React Lib or use our No Code Builder to build exactly the forms you need.
- **Flexible Data Piping:** Pipe your data where you need it. Don’t wait for your form provider to finally build the integration you need.
- **100% Data Ownership:** Since you can self-host snoopForms, you don't need any Data Processing Agreements to be compliant with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPPA, etc.).
- **Built-in Analytics:** How users interact with your form can be as important as their input. Don’t miss anything with comprehensive analytics out of the box.
- **Community Contributions:** We aim for the best possible developer experience. Use what you like, build on top what you need. Contribute to snoopForms to build the last form tool we need.
